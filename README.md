# Keep Fun List
* Creating a struct or class to keep track of an individual activity.
* The most important part is to create a Class (e.g., Fun_Activities) that keeps an array (dynamically allocated) of all of the activities someone wants to do.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Each activity should have the following information:
1. The name of the activity (e.g., Wind Surfing)
2. The location where it takes place (e.g., Gorge)
3. The level of difficult (1-10, where 10 is extreme)
4. Recommendations (e.g., what to take or equipment needed)
5. Add one other feature that you would want to keep track of
